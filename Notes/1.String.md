### Setting and Retrieving Keys
You can store and retrieve key-value pairs in Redis.

#### Example 1: Storing a Single Key-Value Pair
```sh
SET kala kala
GET kala
```

#### Example 2: Creating a Key with a Description Also Do With Redis Exe
```sh
SET wow "This is Wow"
GET wow
```

### Viewing All Stored Keys
To list all keys stored in Redis:

```sh
KEYS *
```

### Storing Multiple Key-Value Pairs
Use `MSET` to store multiple key-value pairs at once:

```sh
MSET key1 "val1" key2 "val2"
```

Use `MGET` to Get multiple values at once:

```sh
MGET key1 "val1" key2 "val2"
```

To retrieve a value associated with a key:

```sh
GET key1
```

## Difference Between `SET` and `SETNX`

Redis provides two commands for setting values: `SET` and `SETNX`.

### `SET`
- This command always sets the value of a key, even if the key already exists.

```sh
SET key1 "val1"
SET key1 "val2"  # Overwrites previous value
```

### `SETNX` (Set If Not Exists)
- This command sets the value only if the key does not exist.

```sh
SETNX key1 "val1"  # Sets key1 to "val1"
SETNX key1 "val2"  # Will not update key1 as it already exists
```

# Check Type Of Key
<!-- Key not exists then it will return none -->
```sh
TYPE key1
```

# Delete Key
Also, delete Multiple keys at once And Only Delete Key If Exists
```sh
DEL key1 key2 key3
```

# Check Key Exists
```sh
EXISTS key1
```

# TTL (Time To Live) For Key

if key not exists then it will return -2
if key exists but not have any expire time then it will return -1
if key exists and have expire time then it will return time in seconds

```sh
TTL key1
```

# Set Expiry Time For Key
```sh
EXPIRE key1 10
```

# Set Expiry Time For Key In Milliseconds
```sh
SETEX sample 200 "lala"
```


# Set Key With Description
```sh
set key4 "This Is Awesome"
```

# GETRANGE
```sh
GETRANGE key4 0 4
```

# SETRANGE
```sh
SETRANGE key4 4 pagal
```
